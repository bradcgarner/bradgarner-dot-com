      already have an urban meadow, or considering what the maintenance requirements might be

      see ... to start planning an urban meadow
      starts from concept to planting

      pick up after planting here

      new meadow
      in temperate climates
      assume normal initial spacing of plants
      maybe 80% of ground is unplanted
        about 50% when looking from sky, 
        but maybe 20% of actual ground has any density of stems
      hopefully mulched

      few different strategies for starting a meadow
      border
      full planting
      adapt traditional ornamental planting
      fairly similar

      first 1-2 years
      same as any planting
      water
      weed

      differences
      do not get hung up on the initial design
      some plants might grow faster than expected
      some might grow more slowly or die
      if the plants die due to transplant trauma (lack of initial water, mishandling, planting at wrong time of year, etc.) they are worth trying again.
      But if the plants start of OK and then "fail to thrive", it very well could be that they were the wrong plants. Bad fit for soil, moisture, light, etc. 
      Better just to try something else.
      Maybe you want daisies... but if daisies do not want to grow where you put them, then you cannot force them if you really want an urban meadow.  Urban meadows allow nature to thrive.  Don't force it.

      weeding becomes very different from a conventional approach.
      Converntional approach is "if I did not plant it, it is a weed".
      Let's narrow our definition of a weed.
      Weeds are de-stabilizing factors
      primarily annual
      quickly growing
      multiply prolifically
      spread quickly
      thrive in disturbed soil
      outcompete desirable plants

      volunteer plants can be beneficial
      Ageratina altissima (White Snakeroot) in my garden


      expect meadow to fill from 20% to 40% in a year
      then maybe to 70% in 2 years
      then maybe 90% by 3 years
      That is when weeding begins to slow down dramatically
      Height also increases approaching mature height

      Replacements
      Traditional approach
      This died and I have a place to fill
      Meadow approach
      Something died, but the area will fill in if I just leave it alone.
      Something died, and I'm not sure what to do, so I will ask for help.
      Something died because the area is too dry, but I don't have much blooming in May, so I will try Alliums. 

      Enjoy the meadow
      Notice when things are blooming
      When nothing is blooming
      Bee and butterfly traffic
      Notice what layers are missing

      Cut back hard

      Fert
      Compost
      Leave some biomass behind
      Check out my pruning technique

      Watering
      Only after initial planting and during extreme drought
      E.g DC watering only needed if no rain for abou 6-8 weeks

      Herbicides, pesticides, fungicides all developed as a chemical solution to dealing with the problem of working against nature:
      Growing plants that cannot deal with competition, are not adapted to insect or fungal pests.

      I want something pretty, and that might be un-natural, so I'll hop it up on chemicals to survive.

      I might want to be thin, but I eat 2 slices of chocolate cake every night, so I'll just take a lot of speed to burn it off.

      Herbicide:
      None.
      Hand-pull, propane torch
      Above all natural weed management due to filling void with desirable plants

      Pesticide:
      Avoid
      Theoretically you are growing plants that were perfectly healthy for millennia without pesticides
      Not exactly the same as the climate is changing
      And some plants might be exotics
      Generally pests attack weak plants and you want hardy plants anyway
      My goldenrod have some scale, always have, probably always will, but it never becomes a problem

      Fungicides
      Same as pesticides



****************

OLD BELOW:

    Weed

Trim

Compost

Use trimmings for compost

Add as needed for balance or interest

Pay attention to bloom times

Notice which pollinators and bees are present

Don’t freak out over pests

See what is blooming when your blossom count is low

Plan for an ornament

Educate yourself and your neighbors

Photograph

Give away plants

Watch out for tall floppy things

******************


First, many forms!

Normal plant selection criteria

    Sun/shade

    Soil

    Moisture, etc

Shape, height, massing

Learn about species native to your area

Care about the plants, the habitat, the benefits, the seasons. Paradigm of manicured ornamental static is not a good fit.

Start small

Embrace change
