My love of plants

Biophilia
Memories of veg

Connection with plants solidified between about 4 and 14
Can look back and relate to living in 2 houses in particular, one from about 4 to 12, another from 12 to about 16, but by probably 14 I was acting upon a passion for plants versus becoming inspired. 

Camping
Woods forest 

Canoeing
Banks ferns

Back yard
Massive oak
Plantings around it
Gully bamboo thickets
Exposed tree root tunnels 
Blackberry vines
Mowing grass liked clean look next to forest
Clearing forest floor
   Usually messy emergent
Trimming brush at grandmother’s
Odd shrubbery formations on pine st
Pine plantings straight rows
Crape myrtles pine st
Crick behind pine st
Euonymus horseshoe drive (hd)
    Wet spot mossy
Hd and pine st hot barren south side
   Moist lush north side
Planting ajuga and ophiopogon grandma hays house
Ditch behind her house and irises
Walnut tree
Cock’s comb seeds aunt billie
Lantana camara
English ivy smell and dog rolling in it
Different smells of cutting different plants
Privet and how it regenerated
Forsythia on pine st

Transplanting clump of wet buttercups vs bracken fern or aesclepias
And what lived multiple seasons vs not

After inspiration
Built fernery
Build brick paver walks and patios
Rearranged shrubs
Began designing plantings

Grew up around a lot of untamed veg
Saw my role as taming (traditional)
Cut, chopped, mowed, trimmed, cleared, added specimens

College fairly traditional

Studied Olmsted
Rehabilitations
Massing
Communities
Wildness
Leaned on my training and importantly youth
Added much more philosophy and guidance
Studied and practiced low-maint
   But this was only a nod
   Low maint was considered mowing and shearing
   Really just meant low skill low understanding

Environmental concern
Own landscape
   Evolution
Stormwater qty and quality
Mowing (gas, clip, fert)
Only fell back on loving the aesthetic later
Pollinators were not a first priority 

Later inspiration
Ben Eiben
Wolfgang Behrens
