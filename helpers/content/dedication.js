				'Urbanmeadow.org is dedicated in the memory of Greg Long.',


				'Greg truly cared about the environment, and I think if he were still with us, he would be an integral part of the Urban Meadow community.  Greg always wanted to try new things.  He loved plants. He loved nature and the outdoors.  He grooved on learning more about plants, nature, and stormwater.  And Greg loved to have a good time!',

				'Greg founded Capitol Green Roofs in 2005, after practicing landscape architecture.  Greg was in the green industry for all the right reasons.  He had a huge, caring heart, and he always wanted to share with others.  Greg’s green roof company was operating in one of the hottest green roof markets in North America, where competition was steep, and many new competitors were entering the field.  This was a proving ground for Greg’s true character.  Instead of making choices to use the cheapest materials and cheapest labor, Greg really cared about quality, and he always tried to use the best materials.  Greg was often out on job sites with his crew, because he liked being part of the team, cared about his people, and loved staying hand-on.',

			  'Greg hosted an online forum that was THE place to exchange ideas in the green roof industry.  And I never found it to be self-promotional, but genuinely centered around sharing of ideas.  Greg really wanted to help grow an industry that was focused on doing something good for the environment.',

			  'I wish I had been closer to Greg.  He was one of the first I met when I entered the green roof industry, and we instantly clicked.  But I was working for one of his competitors, and I was too committed to my company at that time and not committed enough to my own values.  I hope someone reads this and learns from that. Soon after I left that somewhat-bitter firm, I got back in contact with Greg.  We got together a few times, and I let him know how much I had always admired how he conducted business, but Greg never wanted to talk about himself.  The last time I saw him we were supposed to meet for “a drink” before a baseball game (he was going to the game, and I was going to a cousin’s birthday party).  That turned into many, many rounds of drinks, and he skipped the game and went to the birthday party with me.  He didn’t want visitors after he got sick, so I honored those wishes, and if we had to part, I’m glad we parted as we did.',

			  'Greg, may your sense of caring, and sharing, and hope, and perpetual joy live on here.',
